# Sprint 1 Review

**Date:** Sprint 1 close
**Team Members:** Junyi, Le, Jingyi

## Sprint Goal
Validate the product hypothesis, capture user needs and personas, and create a prioritized backlog and architecture decision to start development.

## What We Completed
- Executive summary and product vision documented (Trackly — daily music sharing).  
- User research collected (survey + informal interviews) with validation: 100% interest in a dedicated music-sharing space; 75% find current sharing inconvenient.  
- Three personas created: Bob, Lena, Anna.  
- Product backlog drafted with INVEST-style user stories and initial story point estimates.  
- Technical architecture decision recorded (Django + PostgreSQL + Render).  
- Project repo and board links documented; team working agreements (branch naming, PR SLA, commit format) established.

## Metrics
- Survey respondents: ~6  
- Backlog: ~15–20 initial user stories drafted and prioritized  

## Demo / Artifacts
- Backlog table and user stories in `docs/sprints/sprint-1-planning.md` and project board.  
- Links to wireframes and mockups referenced on the project board.

## Incomplete / Carried Forward
- No backend code was scheduled or implemented in Sprint 1 — implementation planned for Sprint 2.  
- Frontend wireframes require refinement and linking to issues for implementation.  

---

## Stakeholder Feedback
- Instructor/TA guidance: focus on a web app UI and confirm MVP scope before implementing third-party integrations.
