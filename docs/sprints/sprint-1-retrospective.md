# Sprint 1 Retrospective

**Date:** Sprint 1 retrospective
**Attendees:** Junyi, Le, Jingyi

---

## What Went Well
1. Clear product hypothesis and executive summary were written, making the vision explicit.  
2. Personas and user pain points were documented and validated with survey feedback.  
3. A usable, prioritized backlog and technical stack decision (Django/Postgres/Render) were created to enable development in Sprint 2.

## What Didn't Go Well
1. Limited respondent count for the survey — more user interviews would strengthen validation.  
2. Wireframes were referenced but not fully linked to backlog tasks for implementation.  
3. No implementation work occurred; the team needs to ensure early small technical spikes to validate infra assumptions.

## Action Items (owners & due dates)
- Run 5–10 follow-up user interviews to increase validation — **Owner:** Jingyi — **Due:** next sprint kickoff.  
- Link wireframes to specific issues and add acceptance criteria — **Owner:** Le — **Due:** 3 days.  
- Create a small backend spike (auth + DB connectivity) to validate Django/Postgres on Render — **Owner:** Junyi — **Due:** Sprint 2 start.  
- Document token vs session auth decision and expected CORS/CSRF flow for frontend — **Owner:** Le — **Due:** Sprint 2 planning.

## Team Reflections
- The planning surfaced clear priorities and a focused MVP. Prioritize quick technical spikes early to reduce risk and improve estimation accuracy.
