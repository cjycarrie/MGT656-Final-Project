# Sprint 4 Retrospective

## What Went Well
1. Successful upgrade and integration of the Render Postgres instance in our production deployment.
2. Google Analytics was set up seamlessly and is tracking key metrics as needed.
3. The registration system review confirmed we could use existing infrastructure, saving rework time.
4. Team coordination led to smooth technical review and validation of features from all prior sprints.

## What Didn't Go Well
1. The shift in focus toward infrastructure upgrades and analytics prep reduced time for implementing new features.
2. Sprint planning as a team could have been improved. 

## What to Improve for Final Submission
- Finalize and begin A/B test endpoint implementation promptly in next sprint.
- Allocate more buffer time for unexpected registration or infrastructure troubleshooting.
- Streamline final documentation polish and reporting for handoff.

## Action Items for the Next 9 Days Until Final Submission
1. Implement the A/B test endpoint with analytics.
2. Address any new bugs surfaced during infrastructure upgrade and migration.
3. Polish and finalize all documentation and user-facing materials.
4. Continue monitoring analytics data for actionable insights.

## Project Reflection: 

- **We learned:** 
  - Setting up analytics before major feature launches enables better tracking and iterative improvement.
  - Need to confirm whether to create web and mobile applications and reflect this with mockups.
  - Difference between assigning back-end and front-end work versus assigning specific parts of a project. 
  - Schedule infrastructure and analytics upgrades before final delivery sprints.
  - Confirm and document all deployment URLs and configuration details early.
  - Continuous documentation and regular production reviews reduce end-of-project surprises.
