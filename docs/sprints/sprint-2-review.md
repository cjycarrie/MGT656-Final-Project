## Lessons Learned

1. Setting up Render for database and backend deployment is reliable once environment variables are correctly configured. *(Junyi)*  
2. Regular syncs between backend and database help ensure consistent schema understanding. *(Junyi)*
3. Start work early. CORs for remote development between front and backend, file directories really matters
